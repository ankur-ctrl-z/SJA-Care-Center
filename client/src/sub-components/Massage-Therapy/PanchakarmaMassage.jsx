              Understanding Panchakarma Massage: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Panchakarma Massage is a comprehensive Ayurvedic therapy that aims
              to detoxify the body, balance the doshas (energies), and
              rejuvenate the entire being. The word "Panchakarma" means "five
              actions" in Sanskrit, referring to the five main cleansing and
              rejuvenating procedures involved in the treatment. These
              procedures include massage, herbal steam therapy, herbal enemas,
              nasal cleansing, and dietary adjustments. Panchakarma Massage is
              customized to each individual's unique constitution and health
              needs, making it a highly personalized and effective therapy.
