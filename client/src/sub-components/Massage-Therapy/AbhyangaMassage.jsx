              Understanding Abhyanga Massage: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Abhyanga Massage is a form of Ayurvedic massage therapy that has
              been practiced in India for thousands of years. The word
              "Abhyanga" translates to "oil massage" in Sanskrit, and the
              therapy involves the application of medicated herbal oils to the
              entire body. These oils are selected based on the individual's
              dosha (body constitution) and specific health concerns. The
              massage itself is performed using gentle, rhythmic strokes that
              help the oils penetrate deep into the tissues, promoting
              relaxation, detoxification, and rejuvenation.

                <strong>Muscle and Joint Relief:</strong> The warm herbal oils
                used in Abhyanga Massage help soothe sore muscles and alleviate
                joint pain, making it beneficial for conditions such as

                overall health and vitality.

              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Detoxification:</strong> Abhyanga Massage stimulates the
                lymphatic system, aiding in the removal of toxins and waste
                products from the body, promoting detoxification and cleansing.
              </li>
              <li className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Stress Reduction:</strong> The calming and nurturing
                nature of Abhyanga Massage induces deep relaxation, reduces
                stress, and promotes mental clarity and emotional balance.

              How Abhyanga Massage Works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During an Abhyanga Massage session, our skilled practitioners

              strokes. The massage strokes are performed in a specific sequence
              to promote the flow of energy and enhance the therapeutic effects
              of the oils. The massage may also include gentle stretching and
              manipulation techniques to further promote relaxation and
              rejuvenation. Each session is designed to nourish the body, calm
              the mind, and uplift the spirit.
