              What is Blood Cupping (Hijama) Therapy?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Blood Cupping, or Hijama, is a traditional Islamic therapy that
              involves creating small incisions on the skin and using suction
              cups to draw out small amounts of blood. This therapeutic
              technique is believed to promote detoxification and stimulate
              healing.
