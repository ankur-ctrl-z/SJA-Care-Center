            Understanding Acupuncture: What Is It?
          </h2>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
            Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points on the body, known as acupoints. These points lie along meridians, channels through which vital energy (Qi) flows. By stimulating these points, acupuncture aims to restore harmony within the body, alleviate pain, and enhance overall well-being. Unlike acupressure, which uses pressure, acupuncture employs needles inserted gently into the skin.
