              Welcome to SJA Care Center, where we specialize in holistic
              treatments designed to enhance your well-being. Vacuum Cupping
              Therapy is one of our innovative therapies aimed at promoting
              healing and relaxation. What is Vacuum Cupping Therapy? Vacuum
              Cupping Therapy is a therapeutic technique that involves placing
              cups on the skin to create suction. This suction helps to
              stimulate blood flow, relieve muscle tension, and promote the
              body's natural healing processes.
