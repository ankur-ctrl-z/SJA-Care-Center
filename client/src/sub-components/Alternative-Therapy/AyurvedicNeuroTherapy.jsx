              Understanding Ayurvedic Neuro Therapy: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Ayurvedic Neuro Therapy combines the wisdom of Ayurveda, a
              5,000-year-old system of natural healing from India, with modern
              therapeutic practices. This therapy focuses on stimulating nerve
              function, enhancing blood circulation, and restoring the body's
              natural healing processes. It uses specific techniques to balance
              the body's energies (doshas) and address neurological and
              musculoskeletal conditions.
