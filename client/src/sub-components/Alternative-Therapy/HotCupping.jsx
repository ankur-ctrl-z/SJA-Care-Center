            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Hot Cupping Therapy is an ancient practice that involves placing heated cups on the skin to create suction. This suction helps to stimulate blood flow, relieve muscle tension, and promote healing.

              Understanding Hot Cupping: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Hot cupping is a therapeutic practice that involves placing heated cups on the skin to create suction. This technique has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine and other cultures to promote healing and enhance blood flow. The cups are typically made of glass, bamboo, or silicone and are heated before being applied to the skin. The heat creates a vacuum effect, drawing the skin and underlying tissues into the cup, which can help alleviate a variety of health issues.
