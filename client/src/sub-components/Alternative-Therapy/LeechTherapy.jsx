              Understanding Leech Therapy: What Is It?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              Leech therapy involves the use of medicinal leeches to improve
              health by drawing blood and injecting therapeutic substances into
              the body. Medicinal leeches secrete a complex mixture of bioactive
              compounds that include anticoagulants, vasodilators, and
              anti-inflammatory agents. These substances promote blood flow,
              reduce swelling, and support the body’s natural healing processes.
              Leech therapy is recognized for its effectiveness in treating a
              range of conditions, from chronic pain to circulatory disorders.

              Our Approach: The Leech Therapy Experience
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
              During a leech therapy session at SJA Care Services, our skilled
              practitioners carefully apply medicinal leeches to targeted areas
              of concern. The leeches attach themselves to the skin, where they
              draw blood and release therapeutic substances. This process
              typically lasts between 30 to 60 minutes and is generally
              well-tolerated by patients.
