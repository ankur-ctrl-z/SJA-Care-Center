            What is Acupressure Treatment?
          </h2>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5">
            Acupressure is a non-invasive therapy that involves applying gentle
            pressure to specific points on the body. These points correspond to
            energy channels (meridians) believed to influence various aspects of
            health and wellness.
